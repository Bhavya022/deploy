- Create a new collection. 
db.createCollection("people")

- Insert at least 10 documents into the collection, with each document containing at least 3 fields (e.g. name, age, location). 
- Create a compound index on the collection that includes at least 2 fields (e.g. age and location).
db.people.createIndex({ age: 1, location: 1 }) 
- Use the explain() function to analyze the performance of a query that uses the compound index. 
db.people.find({ age: { $gte: 30 }, location: "San Francisco" }).explain()
- Create a single field index on a field that is not included in the compound index. 
db.people.createIndex({ name: 1 })
- Use the explain() function to compare the performance of a query using the single field index to the performance of a query using the compound index.
db.people.find({ name: "Alice" }).explain()
db.people.find({ age: { $gte: 30 }, location: "San Francisco" }).explain()
- Drop the single field index and create a multi-key index on an array field in one of the documents.
db.people.dropIndex("name_1") 

- Use the explain() function to analyze the performance of a query that uses the multi-key index.
